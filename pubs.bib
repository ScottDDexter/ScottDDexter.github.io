	abstract = {A robust image watermarking scheme in curvelet domain is proposed. The curvelet transform directly takes edges as the basic representation element; it provides optimally sparse representations of objects along edges. The image is partitioned into blocks and curvelet transform is applied to those blocks with strong edges. The watermark consists of a pseudorandom sequence is added to the significant curvelet coefficients. The embedding strength of watermark is constrained by a Just Noticeable Distortion model based on Barten's contrast sensitivity function. The developed JND model enables highest possible amount of information hiding without compromising the quality of the data to be protected. The watermarks are blindly detected using correlation detector. A scheme for detection and recovering geometric attacks is applied before watermark detection. The proposed scheme provides an accurate estimation of single and/or combined geometrical distortions and is relied on edge detection and radon transform. The selected threshold for watermark detection is determined on the statistical analysis over the host signals and embedding schemes. Experiments show the fidelity of the protected image is well maintained. The watermark embedded into curvelet coefficients provides high tolerance to severe image quality degradation and robustness against geometric distortions as well.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the experience of STEM and mathematics faculty at four different institutions working collaboratively to integrate learning theory with curriculum development in a core undergraduate linear algebra context. The faculty formed a Professional Learning Community (PLC) with a focus on learning theories in mathematics and curriculum development. Beginning with an online reading seminar, faculty paired with at least one other STEM faculty member at each institution to develop modules collaboratively with each other and with the group as a whole through regular project meetings. Two representative modules from this collaboration are presented with student and faculty feedback. A link is provided to other modules. We consider this a proof-of-concept paper with broader applicability beyond linear algebra to other mathematics and even STEM courses. We focus on linear algebra because it is widely taught in undergraduate mathematics programs and lends itself easily to a variety of applications and geometric analyses. We intend to continue to apply this approach to other content domains. We chose a particular theoretical framework, Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS), because the mathematics education faculty in this group had considerable experience in the development and use of the framework.},

Collecting valuable insights and recommendations in one accessible volume, chapter authors identify key areas in health and wellness where IoT can be used, highlighting the benefits, barriers, and facilitators of these technologies as well as suggesting areas for improvement in current policy and regulations.Four overarching themes provide a suitable setting to examine the critical insights presented in the 31 chapters:Mobile- and sensor-based solutionsOpportunities to incorporate critical aspects of analytics to provide superior insights and thus support better decision-makingCritical issues around aspects of IoT in healthcare contextsApplications of portals in healthcare contextsA comprehensive overview that introduces the critical issues regarding the role of IoT technologies for health, Delivering Superior Health and Wellness Management with IoT and Analytics paves the way for scholars, practitioners, students, and other stakeholders to understand how to substantially improve health and wellness management on a global scale.},
